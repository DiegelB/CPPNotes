C++ notes: GWIN-29932-ZYWW-34 

	Chapter 1:
		
		- each byte in memory has a unique address that identifies it. 
		- each memory location can only store 1 value at a time because it is designed that way. 
		- process control unit:
			1. fetch instructions- copy to ram
			2. decode instructions- determine instructions
			3. execute
			4. store results in ram
		- CPU controls if the information is sent to the ALU (math unit) or execute commands. 
		- Hz = cycles per second G = Giga = Billions 
		- GHz = Billions of cycles per second 
		- IPS: Instructions per second = GHz *# of cores
		- IPS = 2.4 * 8 = 19.2 billion
		
		- Machine language are written in binary
			- Difficult to read
			- Error prone
			- difficult to write programs in, but possible. 
		- low-level language used for communication with computer hardware directly (assembly)
		- high-level language is closer to human language and it is what we code in
		 
		- programming process:
			1. analyze the program and develop a problem specification 
			2. design an algorithmic model to solve the problem 
				1. pseudocode 
				2. flowchart
			3. check your algorithm for errors 
			4. type the program based on the model 
			5. test and debug 
			6. if the program works you're done, otherwise repeat steps 3-4 until it works
